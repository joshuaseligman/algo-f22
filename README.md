# algo-f22

This is the repository with all of my work from my Algorithm Analysis and Design course. All of the code was written in C++ and can be built by calling the `make` command to compile a given project.

Here is an outline of the work done in each assignment:
* Assignment 0: Wrote a limerick to get used to LateX, which was used for all of my reports.
* Assignment 1: Built a singly linked list and used it to create stack and queue classes.
* Assignment 2: Implemented selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quicksort algorithms.
* Assignment 3: Implemented linear and binary search. Also created a hash table that uses chaining to handle collisions.
* Assignment 4: Built undirected graphs using linked objects, matrices, and adjacency lists and used the linked object representation to perform depth-first and breadth-first searches. Also created a binary search tree to look up items in O(log<sub>2</sub> n) time.
* Assignment 5: Created a directed graph with weights and implemented the Bellman-Ford Single Source Shortest Path algorithm. Also implemented the fractional knapsack algorithm to maximize the value of the spice taken.
* Final Project: Implemented the hospitals and residents variation of the stable matching problem. Also created my own algorithm to solve a variation of the problem in which the hospitals no longer rank residents and stability is defined as the best average placement for the residents based on their rankings.
